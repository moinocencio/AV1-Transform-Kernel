  abstract = {As adoption of the newly standardized H.264 becomes increasingly more widespread, efforts must be made to transcode video from earlier standards, such as MPEG-2, to the H.264 format. One aspect of transcoding is the conversion from the discrete cosine transform (DCT) used in MPEG-2 to the integer-based DCT of H.264, the integer cosine transform. By investigating the structure of the transform kernels, two efficient schemes are introduced to convert an 8 times 8 DCT block into its corresponding four 4times4 integer cosine transform block8 times 8 DCT block into its corresponding four 4times4 integer cosine transform blockss. An analysis of computational complexity shows a reduction of up to 42\% in multiplications over existing conversion schemes, while simulations of the conversion system with pre- and post-quantization show that the proposed methods yield high fidelity in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio. Further approximation of matrix coefficients in the second proposed method yields additional conversion schemes which require no multiplications. These also provide comparable quality with fewer operations than existing schemes. Thus, the proposed transform conversion methods can potentially contribute to efficient transcoding systems.},

  title = {4 \texttimes{} 4 Parametric Integer Discrete Cosine Transforms},
  abstract = {One of the famous transformations is discrete cosine transform (DCT), which is always used in digital image coding standards like JPEG and MPEG. DCT has different types and all of DCTs have excellent energy compaction properties. Meanwhile, matrices of DCTs II and IV are examined by a lot of researchers. However, other types of DCTs are rarely developed. Therefore, this paper presents 4 \texttimes{} 4 parametric integer DCTs, which cannot only represent DCTs II and IV but other types of DCTs (i.e. DCT I, V, VIII). It shows an excellent performance in terms of mean square errors and transform coding gains while it is comparing with state of the art.},

  abstract = {Discrete cosine transform (DCT) is an important tool in digital signal processing. In this paper, based on our previous work of performing DCT via linear sums of discrete moments, we have made development to eliminate multiplications in discrete cosine transforms by performing appropriate bit operations and shift in binary system, which can be implemented by integer additions of fixed points. An efficient and regular systolic array is designed to implement it, and the complexity analysis is also given. Different to other fast cosine transforms, our algorithm can deal with arbitrary length signals and get high precision. The approach is also applicable to multi-dimensional DCT and DCT inverses.},

  abstract = {High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is the most recent video encoding standard that achieves much higher compression while maintaining the same quality as its predecessor x264. This is done by a variety of upgrades for example a more diverse transform block size while some fundamental methods remain unchanged. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) along with an alternate Discrete Sine Transform (DST) is used by HEVC before quantization to achieve a lossless encoding of transform blocks. Both of these transforms are implemented in HEVC encoder using CPU. In this paper we implement these transforms on GPU using CUDA and analyze their performance compared to the default implementation. Using a batched kernel call 48\% and 13\% improvement is achieved on Inverse 32\texttimes{}32 and 16\texttimes{}16 DCT transform respectively compared to SIMD while our GPU implementation outperforms other CPU implementations on every transform. We also present a benchmark software for this very purpose which we will use to measure their performance real time.},

  title = {The Integer Transforms Analogous to Discrete Trigonometric Transforms},
  volume = {48},
  issn = {1053-587X},
  abstract = {The integer transform (such as the Walsh transform) is the discrete transform that all the entries of the transform matrix are integer. It is much easier to implement because the real number multiplication operations can be avoided, but the performance is usually worse. On the other hand, the noninteger transform, such as the DFT and DCT, has a good performance, but real number multiplication is required. W derive the integer transforms analogous to some popular noninteger transforms. These integer transforms retain most of the performance quality of the original transform, but the implementation is much simpler. Especially, for the two-dimensional (2-D) block transform in image/video, the saving can be huge using integer operations. In 1989, Cham had derived the integer cosine transform. Here, we will derive the integer sine, Hartley, and Fourier transforms. We also introduce the general method to derive the integer transform from some noninteger transform. Besides, the integer transform derived by Cham still requires real number multiplication for the inverse transform. We modify the integer transform introduced by Cham and introduce the complete integer transform. It requires no real number multiplication operation, no matter what the forward or inverse transform. The integer transform we derive would be more efficient than the original transform. For example, for the 8-point DFT and IDFT, there are in total four real numbers and eight fixed-point multiplication operations required, but for the forward and inverse 8-point complete integer Fourier transforms, there are totally 20 fixed-point multiplication operations required. However, for the integer transform, the implementation is simpler, and many of the properties of the original transform are kept.},

  abstract = {The growing requirements for broadcasting and streaming of high quality video continue to trigger demands for codecs with higher compression efficiency. AV1 is the most recent open and royalty free video coding specification developed by Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) with a declared ambition of becoming the most popular next generation video coding standard. Primary alternatives to AV1 are the VP9 and the HEVC/H.265 which are currently among the most popular and widespread video codecs used in applications. VP9 is also a royalty free and open specification similar to AV1, while HEVC/H.265 requires specific licensing terms for its use in commercial products and services. In this paper, we compare AV1 to VP9 and HEVC/H.265 from rate distortion point of view in a broadcasting use case scenario. Mutual comparison is performed by means of subjective evaluations carried out in a controlled environment using HD video content with typical bitrates ranging from low to high, corresponding to very low up to completely transparent quality. We then proceed with an in-depth analysis of advantages and drawbacks of each codec for specific types of content and compare the subjective comparisons and conclusions to those obtained by others in the state of the art as well to those measured by means of objective metrics such as PSNR.},

The proposed solution converts floating-point arithmetic operations into integer arithmetic operations, replacing highly computational demanding blocks such as discrete cosine transform (DCT), weighting (W) and quantization (Q) by fast integer calculations using only shifts and additions. The overall computational complexity was reduced by 73\% in comparison to a floating-point implementation. Our solution is suitable to be programmed into any fixed-point arithmetic processor decreasing the consumer equipment cost. This solution is still compatible with the standard in terms of the DCT precision requirements.},

  abstract = {Several standardized video coding algorithms use a well known discrete cosine transform (DCT) at the encoder to remove redundancy from video random processes. Its inverse, the IDCT is present at the decoder as well as at the encoder loop. The accuracy of this inverse transform, required to avoid large drift between the encoder and decoder, is defined in an IEEE standard which will be withdrawn from MPEG and ITU standardized codecs. Due to the huge number of computations required to compute the FDCT/IDCT (forward/inverse DCT) pair, reduction of their complexity is essential to speed up the video processing. In this paper, we propose a fast integer IDCT calculation method. Additionally, we insert it into the MPEG-4 (Part 2) reference software in order to validate our proposed method. The testing results using two different video sequences, at QCIF resolution, show similar PSNR average values between the reference MPEG-4 and the proposed MPEG-4 codec},

  volume = {48},

  abstract = {The integer transform (such as the Walsh transform) is the discrete transform that all the entries of the transform matrix are integer. It is much easier to implement because the real number multiplication operations can be avoided, but the performance is usually worse. On the other hand, the noninteger transform, such as the DFT and DCT, has a good performance, but real number multiplication is required. W derive the integer transforms analogous to some popular noninteger transforms. These integer transforms retain most of the performance quality of the original transform, but the implementation is much simpler. Especially, for the two-dimensional (2-D) block transform in image/video, the saving can be huge using integer operations. In 1989, Cham had derived the integer cosine transform. Here, we will derive the integer sine, Hartley, and Fourier transforms. We also introduce the general method to derive the integer transform from some noninteger transform. Besides, the integer transform derived by Cham still requires real number multiplication for the inverse transform. We modify the integer transform introduced by Cham and introduce the complete integer transform. It requires no real number multiplication operation, no matter what the forward or inverse transform. The integer transform we derive would be more efficient than the original transform. For example, for the 8-point DFT and IDFT, there are in total four real numbers and eight fixed-point multiplication operations required, but for the forward and inverse 8-point complete integer Fourier transforms, there are totally 20 fixed-point multiplication operations required. However, for the integer transform, the implementation is simpler, and many of the properties of the original transform are kept.},

The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is widely used for image and video compression including HEVC. This paper proposes a variablelength DCT architecture for encoding video according to the HEVC/H.265 specifications. The architecture is optimized for most likely block sizes in ultra-high definition (UHD) video, and eliminates unnecessary complexities found in many architectures proposed.

FPGAs have been placed as parts on embedded systems to carry heavy loads out of the processors or microcontrollers. The main advantage of FPGAs is that they can do more than one job in parallel. The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is often used in signal and image processing, especially lossy data compression, because it has a strong "energy compaction" property. The aim of this project is to solve the problem of implementing DCT algorithm on FPGA using Hardware Descriptive Languages (HDLs). The design will be optimized to decrease consumed logic cells and therefore provide maximum hardware utilization. The designed system was implemented and tested. The results were as expected; however some limitations were discovered and should be eliminated in the future.},

  title = {The Contrast Sensitivity of Human Color Vision to Red-Green and Blue-Yellow Chromatic Gratings},
  volume = {359},
  abstract = {A method of producing red-green and blue-yellow sinusoidal chromatic gratings is used which permits the correction of all chromatic aberrations. A quantitative criterion is adopted to choose the intensity match of the two colours in the stimulus: this is the intensity ratio at which contrast sensitivity for the chromatic grating differs most from the contrast sensitivity for a monochromatic luminance grating. Results show that this intensity match varies with spatial frequency and does not necessarily correspond to a luminance match between the colours. Contrast sensitivities to the chromatic gratings at the criterion intensity match are measured as a function of spatial frequency, using field sizes ranging from 2 to 23 deg. Both blue-yellow and red-green contrast sensitivity functions have similar low-pass characteristics, with no low-frequency attenuation even at low frequencies below 0.1 cycles/deg. These functions indicate that the limiting acuities based on red-green and blue-yellow colour discriminations are similar at 11 or 12 cycles/deg. Comparisons between contrast sensitivity functions for the chromatic and monochromatic gratings are made at the same mean luminances. Results show that, at low spatial frequencies below 0.5 cycles/deg, contrast sensitivity is greater to the chromatic gratings, consisting of two monochromatic gratings added in antiphase, than to either monochromatic grating alone. Above 0.5 cycles/deg, contrast sensitivity is greater to monochromatic than to chromatic gratings.},

With the growing demand for better bandwidth utilization, efficient image data compression techniques have emerged as an important factor for image data transmission and storage. To date, different approaches to image compression have been developed like the classical predictive coding, popular transform coding and vector quantization. Several second generation coding schemes or the segmentation based schemes are also gaining popularity. Practically efficient compression systems based on hybrid coding which combines the advantages of different traditional methods of image coding have also being developed over the years. In this paper, different hybrid approaches to image compression are discussed. Hybrid coding of images, in this context, deals with combining two or more traditional approaches to enhance the individual methods and achieve better quality reconstructed images with higher compression ratio. Literature on hybrid techniques of image coding over the past years is also reviewed. An attempt is made to highlight the neuro-wavelet approach for enhancing coding efficiency.},

  abstract = {The hybrid transform coding scheme that alternates amongst the asymmetric discrete sine transform (ADST) and the discrete cosine transform (DCT) depending on the boundary prediction conditions, is an efficient tool for video and image compression. It optimally exploits the statistical characteristics of prediction residual, thereby achieving significant coding performance gains over the conventional DCT-based approach. A practical concern lies in the intrinsic conflict between transform kernels of ADST and DCT, which prevents a butterfly structured implementation for parallel computing. Hence the hybrid transform coding scheme has to rely on matrix multiplication, which presents a speed-up barrier due to under-utilization of the hardware, especially for larger block sizes. In this work, we devise a novel ADSTlike transform whose kernel is consistent with that of DCT, thereby enabling butterfly structured computation flow, while largely retaining the performance advantages of hybrid transform coding scheme in terms of compression efficiency. A prototype implementation of the proposed butterfly structured hybrid transform coding scheme is available in the VP9 codec repository.},

  abstract = {A new family of unitary transforms is introduced. It is shown that the well-known discrete Fourier, cosine, sine, and the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) (for first-order stationary Markov processes) transforms are members of this family. All the member transforms of this family are sinusoidal sequences that are asymptotically equivalent. For finite-length data, these transforms provide different approximations to the KL transform of the said data. From the theory of these transforms some well-known facts about orthogonal transforms are easily explained and some widely misunderstood concepts are brought to light. For example, the near-optimal behavior of the even discrete cosine transform to the KL transform of first-order Markov processes is explained and, at the same time, it is shown that this transform is not always such a good (or near-optimal) approximation to the above-mentioned KL transform. It is also shown that each member of the sinusoidal family is the KL transform of a unique, first-order, non-stationary (in general), Markov process. Asymptotic equivalence and other interesting properties of these transforms can be studied by analyzing the underlying Markov processes.},

We may test whether a given code is sufficient, in the sense of retaining all the information that the human perceives, and necessary, in the sense of retaining only that information. The latter is a test of efficiency. Here, we explore a code modeled on the simple cells of the primate striate cortex. The Cortex transform maps a digital image into a set of subimages (layers) that are bandpass in spatial frequency and orientation. The layers are sampled so as to minimize the number of samples and still avoid aliasing. Samples are quantized in a manner that exploits the bandpass contrast-masking properties of human vision. The entropy of the samples is computed to provide a lower bound on the code size. Finally, the image is reconstructed from the code. We devise psychophysical methods for comparing the original and reconstructed images to evaluate the sufficiency of the code. When each resolution is coded at the threshold for detection artifacts, the image-code size is about 1 bit/pixel.},
