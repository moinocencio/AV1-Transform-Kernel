  abstract = {In this letter, a novel image restoring technique for interlaced video is presented. We employ a motion-degree detector to determine the type of motion in the adjacent pictures efficiently and a hybrid interpolation based on spatial and/or temporal information to restore the missing pixels for each motion type. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can obtain better performances in terms of both quantitative evaluation and visual quality than the state-of-the-art image restoring techniques. Since the proposed method requires low computational complexity, it is very suitable for real-time hardware implementation and can be applied to current television systems.},
