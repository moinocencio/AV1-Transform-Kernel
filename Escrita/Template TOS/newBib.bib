We employ a motion-degree detector to determine the type of motion in the adjacent pictures efficiently and a hybrid interpolation based on spatial and/or temporal information to restore the missing pixels for each motion type. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can obtain better performances in terms of both quantitative evaluation and visual quality than the state-of-the-art image restoring techniques. Since the proposed method requires low computational complexity, it is very suitable for real-time hardware implementation and can be applied to current television systems.},

  title = {{{MPEG}}-4 {{Codec Performance}} Using a {{Fast Integer IDCT}}},
  abstract = {Several standardized video coding algorithms use a well known discrete cosine transform (DCT) at the encoder to remove redundancy from video random processes. Its inverse, the IDCT is present at the decoder as well as at the encoder loop. The accuracy of this inverse transform, required to avoid large drift between the encoder and decoder, is defined in an IEEE standard which will be withdrawn from MPEG and ITU standardized codecs. Due to the huge number of computations required to compute the FDCT/IDCT (forward/inverse DCT) pair, reduction of their complexity is essential to speed up the video processing. In this paper, we propose a fast integer IDCT calculation method. Additionally, we insert it into the MPEG-4 (Part 2) reference software in order to validate our proposed method. The testing results using two different video sequences, at QCIF resolution, show similar PSNR average values between the reference MPEG-4 and the proposed MPEG-4 codec},

The proposed solution converts floating-point arithmetic operations into integer arithmetic operations, replacing highly computational demanding blocks such as discrete cosine transform (DCT), weighting (W) and quantization (Q) by fast integer calculations using only shifts and additions. The overall computational complexity was reduced by 73\% in comparison to a floating-point implementation. Our solution is suitable to be programmed into any fixed-point arithmetic processor decreasing the consumer equipment cost. This solution is still compatible with the standard in terms of the DCT precision requirements.},
