We employ a motion-degree detector to determine the type of motion in the adjacent pictures efficiently and a hybrid interpolation based on spatial and/or temporal information to restore the missing pixels for each motion type. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can obtain better performances in terms of both quantitative evaluation and visual quality than the state-of-the-art image restoring techniques. Since the proposed method requires low computational complexity, it is very suitable for real-time hardware implementation and can be applied to current television systems.},

  title = {{{MPEG}}-4 {{Codec Performance}} Using a {{Fast Integer IDCT}}},
  abstract = {Several standardized video coding algorithms use a well known discrete cosine transform (DCT) at the encoder to remove redundancy from video random processes. Its inverse, the IDCT is present at the decoder as well as at the encoder loop. The accuracy of this inverse transform, required to avoid large drift between the encoder and decoder, is defined in an IEEE standard which will be withdrawn from MPEG and ITU standardized codecs. Due to the huge number of computations required to compute the FDCT/IDCT (forward/inverse DCT) pair, reduction of their complexity is essential to speed up the video processing. In this paper, we propose a fast integer IDCT calculation method. Additionally, we insert it into the MPEG-4 (Part 2) reference software in order to validate our proposed method. The testing results using two different video sequences, at QCIF resolution, show similar PSNR average values between the reference MPEG-4 and the proposed MPEG-4 codec},

The overall computational complexity was reduced by 73\% in comparison to a floating-point implementation. Our solution is suitable to be programmed into any fixed-point arithmetic processor decreasing the consumer equipment cost. This solution is still compatible with the standard in terms of the DCT precision requirements.},

  abstract = {The growing requirements for broadcasting and streaming of high quality video continue to trigger demands for codecs with higher compression efficiency. AV1 is the most recent open and royalty free video coding specification developed by Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) with a declared ambition of becoming the most popular next generation video coding standard. Primary alternatives to AV1 are the VP9 and the HEVC/H.265 which are currently among the most popular and widespread video codecs used in applications. VP9 is also a royalty free and open specification similar to AV1, while HEVC/H.265 requires specific licensing terms for its use in commercial products and services. In this paper, we compare AV1 to VP9 and HEVC/H.265 from rate distortion point of view in a broadcasting use case scenario. Mutual comparison is performed by means of subjective evaluations carried out in a controlled environment using HD video content with typical bitrates ranging from low to high, corresponding to very low up to completely transparent quality. We then proceed with an in-depth analysis of advantages and drawbacks of each codec for specific types of content and compare the subjective comparisons and conclusions to those obtained by others in the state of the art as well to those measured by means of objective metrics such as PSNR.},

  volume = {48},
  issn = {1053-587X},
  abstract = {The integer transform (such as the Walsh transform) is the discrete transform that all the entries of the transform matrix are integer. It is much easier to implement because the real number multiplication operations can be avoided, but the performance is usually worse. On the other hand, the noninteger transform, such as the DFT and DCT, has a good performance, but real number multiplication is required. W derive the integer transforms analogous to some popular noninteger transforms. These integer transforms retain most of the performance quality of the original transform, but the implementation is much simpler. Especially, for the two-dimensional (2-D) block transform in image/video, the saving can be huge using integer operations. In 1989, Cham had derived the integer cosine transform. Here, we will derive the integer sine, Hartley, and Fourier transforms. We also introduce the general method to derive the integer transform from some noninteger transform. Besides, the integer transform derived by Cham still requires real number multiplication for the inverse transform. We modify the integer transform introduced by Cham and introduce the complete integer transform. It requires no real number multiplication operation, no matter what the forward or inverse transform. The integer transform we derive would be more efficient than the original transform. For example, for the 8-point DFT and IDFT, there are in total four real numbers and eight fixed-point multiplication operations required, but for the forward and inverse 8-point complete integer Fourier transforms, there are totally 20 fixed-point multiplication operations required. However, for the integer transform, the implementation is simpler, and many of the properties of the original transform are kept.},

  abstract = {High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is the most recent video encoding standard that achieves much higher compression while maintaining the same quality as its predecessor x264. This is done by a variety of upgrades for example a more diverse transform block size while some fundamental methods remain unchanged. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) along with an alternate Discrete Sine Transform (DST) is used by HEVC before quantization to achieve a lossless encoding of transform blocks. Both of these transforms are implemented in HEVC encoder using CPU. In this paper we implement these transforms on GPU using CUDA and analyze their performance compared to the default implementation. Using a batched kernel call 48\% and 13\% improvement is achieved on Inverse 32\texttimes{}32 and 16\texttimes{}16 DCT transform respectively compared to SIMD while our GPU implementation outperforms other CPU implementations on every transform. We also present a benchmark software for this very purpose which we will use to measure their performance real time.},

In this paper, based on our previous work of performing DCT via linear sums of discrete moments, we have made development to eliminate multiplications in discrete cosine transforms by performing appropriate bit operations and shift in binary system, which can be implemented by integer additions of fixed points. An efficient and regular systolic array is designed to implement it, and the complexity analysis is also given. Different to other fast cosine transforms, our algorithm can deal with arbitrary length signals and get high precision. The approach is also applicable to multi-dimensional DCT and DCT inverses.},

Although some conventional integer DCT-IIs (IntDCT-IIs) with block size 8 have been proposed, they are not generalized as arbitrary block size M. Using block lifting factorization which has an efficient structure for lossless-to-lossy image coding, we present IntDCT-IIs and IVs with arbitrary block size M that is called block lifting-based DCT-IIs and IVs (BLDCT-IIs and IVs). Finally, the validity of our method is proved by showing the results of lossless-to-lossy image coding in the most general case of the block size 8 and the extended size 16.},

  abstract = {As adoption of the newly standardized H.264 becomes increasingly more widespread, efforts must be made to transcode video from earlier standards, such as MPEG-2, to the H.264 format. One aspect of transcoding is the conversion from the discrete cosine transform (DCT) used in MPEG-2 to the integer-based DCT of H.264, the integer cosine transform. By investigating the structure of the transform kernels, two efficient schemes are introduced to convert an 8 times 8 DCT block into its corresponding four 4times4 integer cosine transform block8 times 8 DCT block into its corresponding four 4times4 integer cosine transform blockss. An analysis of computational complexity shows a reduction of up to 42\% in multiplications over existing conversion schemes, while simulations of the conversion system with pre- and post-quantization show that the proposed methods yield high fidelity in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio. Further approximation of matrix coefficients in the second proposed method yields additional conversion schemes which require no multiplications. These also provide comparable quality with fewer operations than existing schemes. Thus, the proposed transform conversion methods can potentially contribute to efficient transcoding systems.},
