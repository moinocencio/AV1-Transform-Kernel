DCT Kernels developed in VHDL, aimed at the AV1 video coding standard.

Reference software (`libaom`) obtained from AOMedia (https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/).

Repo contains modified reference software, as well as the developed DCT architectures.

The presented work is far from being optimized, serving only as proof of concept.
