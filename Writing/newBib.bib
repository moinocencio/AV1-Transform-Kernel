  abstract = {As adoption of the newly standardized H.264 becomes increasingly more widespread, efforts must be made to transcode video from earlier standards, such as MPEG-2, to the H.264 format. One aspect of transcoding is the conversion from the discrete cosine transform (DCT) used in MPEG-2 to the integer-based DCT of H.264, the integer cosine transform. By investigating the structure of the transform kernels, two efficient schemes are introduced to convert an 8 times 8 DCT block into its corresponding four 4times4 integer cosine transform block8 times 8 DCT block into its corresponding four 4times4 integer cosine transform blockss. An analysis of computational complexity shows a reduction of up to 42\% in multiplications over existing conversion schemes, while simulations of the conversion system with pre- and post-quantization show that the proposed methods yield high fidelity in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio. Further approximation of matrix coefficients in the second proposed method yields additional conversion schemes which require no multiplications. These also provide comparable quality with fewer operations than existing schemes. Thus, the proposed transform conversion methods can potentially contribute to efficient transcoding systems.},

  abstract = {One of the famous transformations is discrete cosine transform (DCT), which is always used in digital image coding standards like JPEG and MPEG. DCT has different types and all of DCTs have excellent energy compaction properties. Meanwhile, matrices of DCTs II and IV are examined by a lot of researchers. However, other types of DCTs are rarely developed. Therefore, this paper presents 4 \texttimes{} 4 parametric integer DCTs, which cannot only represent DCTs II and IV but other types of DCTs (i.e. DCT I, V, VIII). It shows an excellent performance in terms of mean square errors and transform coding gains while it is comparing with state of the art.},

In this paper, based on our previous work of performing DCT via linear sums of discrete moments, we have made development to eliminate multiplications in discrete cosine transforms by performing appropriate bit operations and shift in binary system, which can be implemented by integer additions of fixed points. An efficient and regular systolic array is designed to implement it, and the complexity analysis is also given. Different to other fast cosine transforms, our algorithm can deal with arbitrary length signals and get high precision. The approach is also applicable to multi-dimensional DCT and DCT inverses.},

  abstract = {High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is the most recent video encoding standard that achieves much higher compression while maintaining the same quality as its predecessor x264. This is done by a variety of upgrades for example a more diverse transform block size while some fundamental methods remain unchanged. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) along with an alternate Discrete Sine Transform (DST) is used by HEVC before quantization to achieve a lossless encoding of transform blocks. Both of these transforms are implemented in HEVC encoder using CPU. In this paper we implement these transforms on GPU using CUDA and analyze their performance compared to the default implementation. Using a batched kernel call 48\% and 13\% improvement is achieved on Inverse 32\texttimes{}32 and 16\texttimes{}16 DCT transform respectively compared to SIMD while our GPU implementation outperforms other CPU implementations on every transform. We also present a benchmark software for this very purpose which we will use to measure their performance real time.},

  title = {The Integer Transforms Analogous to Discrete Trigonometric Transforms},
  volume = {48},
  issn = {1053-587X},
  abstract = {The integer transform (such as the Walsh transform) is the discrete transform that all the entries of the transform matrix are integer. It is much easier to implement because the real number multiplication operations can be avoided, but the performance is usually worse. On the other hand, the noninteger transform, such as the DFT and DCT, has a good performance, but real number multiplication is required. W derive the integer transforms analogous to some popular noninteger transforms. These integer transforms retain most of the performance quality of the original transform, but the implementation is much simpler. Especially, for the two-dimensional (2-D) block transform in image/video, the saving can be huge using integer operations. In 1989, Cham had derived the integer cosine transform. Here, we will derive the integer sine, Hartley, and Fourier transforms. We also introduce the general method to derive the integer transform from some noninteger transform. Besides, the integer transform derived by Cham still requires real number multiplication for the inverse transform. We modify the integer transform introduced by Cham and introduce the complete integer transform. It requires no real number multiplication operation, no matter what the forward or inverse transform. The integer transform we derive would be more efficient than the original transform. For example, for the 8-point DFT and IDFT, there are in total four real numbers and eight fixed-point multiplication operations required, but for the forward and inverse 8-point complete integer Fourier transforms, there are totally 20 fixed-point multiplication operations required. However, for the integer transform, the implementation is simpler, and many of the properties of the original transform are kept.},

  abstract = {The growing requirements for broadcasting and streaming of high quality video continue to trigger demands for codecs with higher compression efficiency. AV1 is the most recent open and royalty free video coding specification developed by Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) with a declared ambition of becoming the most popular next generation video coding standard. Primary alternatives to AV1 are the VP9 and the HEVC/H.265 which are currently among the most popular and widespread video codecs used in applications. VP9 is also a royalty free and open specification similar to AV1, while HEVC/H.265 requires specific licensing terms for its use in commercial products and services. In this paper, we compare AV1 to VP9 and HEVC/H.265 from rate distortion point of view in a broadcasting use case scenario. Mutual comparison is performed by means of subjective evaluations carried out in a controlled environment using HD video content with typical bitrates ranging from low to high, corresponding to very low up to completely transparent quality. We then proceed with an in-depth analysis of advantages and drawbacks of each codec for specific types of content and compare the subjective comparisons and conclusions to those obtained by others in the state of the art as well to those measured by means of objective metrics such as PSNR.},

The proposed solution converts floating-point arithmetic operations into integer arithmetic operations, replacing highly computational demanding blocks such as discrete cosine transform (DCT), weighting (W) and quantization (Q) by fast integer calculations using only shifts and additions. The overall computational complexity was reduced by 73\% in comparison to a floating-point implementation. Our solution is suitable to be programmed into any fixed-point arithmetic processor decreasing the consumer equipment cost. This solution is still compatible with the standard in terms of the DCT precision requirements.},

  abstract = {Several standardized video coding algorithms use a well known discrete cosine transform (DCT) at the encoder to remove redundancy from video random processes. Its inverse, the IDCT is present at the decoder as well as at the encoder loop. The accuracy of this inverse transform, required to avoid large drift between the encoder and decoder, is defined in an IEEE standard which will be withdrawn from MPEG and ITU standardized codecs. Due to the huge number of computations required to compute the FDCT/IDCT (forward/inverse DCT) pair, reduction of their complexity is essential to speed up the video processing. In this paper, we propose a fast integer IDCT calculation method. Additionally, we insert it into the MPEG-4 (Part 2) reference software in order to validate our proposed method. The testing results using two different video sequences, at QCIF resolution, show similar PSNR average values between the reference MPEG-4 and the proposed MPEG-4 codec},

FPGAs have been placed as parts on embedded systems to carry heavy loads out of the processors or microcontrollers. The main advantage of FPGAs is that they can do more than one job in parallel. The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is often used in signal and image processing, especially lossy data compression, because it has a strong "energy compaction" property. The aim of this project is to solve the problem of implementing DCT algorithm on FPGA using Hardware Descriptive Languages (HDLs). The design will be optimized to decrease consumed logic cells and therefore provide maximum hardware utilization. The designed system was implemented and tested. The results were as expected; however some limitations were discovered and should be eliminated in the future.},

  volume = {48},

  abstract = {The integer transform (such as the Walsh transform) is the discrete transform that all the entries of the transform matrix are integer. It is much easier to implement because the real number multiplication operations can be avoided, but the performance is usually worse. On the other hand, the noninteger transform, such as the DFT and DCT, has a good performance, but real number multiplication is required. W derive the integer transforms analogous to some popular noninteger transforms. These integer transforms retain most of the performance quality of the original transform, but the implementation is much simpler. Especially, for the two-dimensional (2-D) block transform in image/video, the saving can be huge using integer operations. In 1989, Cham had derived the integer cosine transform. Here, we will derive the integer sine, Hartley, and Fourier transforms. We also introduce the general method to derive the integer transform from some noninteger transform. Besides, the integer transform derived by Cham still requires real number multiplication for the inverse transform. We modify the integer transform introduced by Cham and introduce the complete integer transform. It requires no real number multiplication operation, no matter what the forward or inverse transform. The integer transform we derive would be more efficient than the original transform. For example, for the 8-point DFT and IDFT, there are in total four real numbers and eight fixed-point multiplication operations required, but for the forward and inverse 8-point complete integer Fourier transforms, there are totally 20 fixed-point multiplication operations required. However, for the integer transform, the implementation is simpler, and many of the properties of the original transform are kept.},

It is shown that the well-known discrete Fourier, cosine, sine, and the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) (for first-order stationary Markov processes) transforms are members of this family. All the member transforms of this family are sinusoidal sequences that are asymptotically equivalent. For finite-length data, these transforms provide different approximations to the KL transform of the said data. From the theory of these transforms some well-known facts about orthogonal transforms are easily explained and some widely misunderstood concepts are brought to light. For example, the near-optimal behavior of the even discrete cosine transform to the KL transform of first-order Markov processes is explained and, at the same time, it is shown that this transform is not always such a good (or near-optimal) approximation to the above-mentioned KL transform. It is also shown that each member of the sinusoidal family is the KL transform of a unique, first-order, non-stationary (in general), Markov process. Asymptotic equivalence and other interesting properties of these transforms can be studied by analyzing the underlying Markov processes.},

  abstract = {The hybrid transform coding scheme that alternates amongst the asymmetric discrete sine transform (ADST) and the discrete cosine transform (DCT) depending on the boundary prediction conditions, is an efficient tool for video and image compression. It optimally exploits the statistical characteristics of prediction residual, thereby achieving significant coding performance gains over the conventional DCT-based approach. A practical concern lies in the intrinsic conflict between transform kernels of ADST and DCT, which prevents a butterfly structured implementation for parallel computing. Hence the hybrid transform coding scheme has to rely on matrix multiplication, which presents a speed-up barrier due to under-utilization of the hardware, especially for larger block sizes. In this work, we devise a novel ADSTlike transform whose kernel is consistent with that of DCT, thereby enabling butterfly structured computation flow, while largely retaining the performance advantages of hybrid transform coding scheme in terms of compression efficiency. A prototype implementation of the proposed butterfly structured hybrid transform coding scheme is available in the VP9 codec repository.},

With the growing demand for better bandwidth utilization, efficient image data compression techniques have emerged as an important factor for image data transmission and storage. To date, different approaches to image compression have been developed like the classical predictive coding, popular transform coding and vector quantization. Several second generation coding schemes or the segmentation based schemes are also gaining popularity. Practically efficient compression systems based on hybrid coding which combines the advantages of different traditional methods of image coding have also being developed over the years. In this paper, different hybrid approaches to image compression are discussed. Hybrid coding of images, in this context, deals with combining two or more traditional approaches to enhance the individual methods and achieve better quality reconstructed images with higher compression ratio. Literature on hybrid techniques of image coding over the past years is also reviewed. An attempt is made to highlight the neuro-wavelet approach for enhancing coding efficiency.},

  volume = {359},
  abstract = {A method of producing red-green and blue-yellow sinusoidal chromatic gratings is used which permits the correction of all chromatic aberrations. A quantitative criterion is adopted to choose the intensity match of the two colours in the stimulus: this is the intensity ratio at which contrast sensitivity for the chromatic grating differs most from the contrast sensitivity for a monochromatic luminance grating. Results show that this intensity match varies with spatial frequency and does not necessarily correspond to a luminance match between the colours. Contrast sensitivities to the chromatic gratings at the criterion intensity match are measured as a function of spatial frequency, using field sizes ranging from 2 to 23 deg. Both blue-yellow and red-green contrast sensitivity functions have similar low-pass characteristics, with no low-frequency attenuation even at low frequencies below 0.1 cycles/deg. These functions indicate that the limiting acuities based on red-green and blue-yellow colour discriminations are similar at 11 or 12 cycles/deg. Comparisons between contrast sensitivity functions for the chromatic and monochromatic gratings are made at the same mean luminances. Results show that, at low spatial frequencies below 0.5 cycles/deg, contrast sensitivity is greater to the chromatic gratings, consisting of two monochromatic gratings added in antiphase, than to either monochromatic grating alone. Above 0.5 cycles/deg, contrast sensitivity is greater to monochromatic than to chromatic gratings.},

We may test whether a given code is sufficient, in the sense of retaining all the information that the human perceives, and necessary, in the sense of retaining only that information. The latter is a test of efficiency. Here, we explore a code modeled on the simple cells of the primate striate cortex. The Cortex transform maps a digital image into a set of subimages (layers) that are bandpass in spatial frequency and orientation. The layers are sampled so as to minimize the number of samples and still avoid aliasing. Samples are quantized in a manner that exploits the bandpass contrast-masking properties of human vision. The entropy of the samples is computed to provide a lower bound on the code size. Finally, the image is reconstructed from the code. We devise psychophysical methods for comparing the original and reconstructed images to evaluate the sufficiency of the code. When each resolution is coded at the threshold for detection artifacts, the image-code size is about 1 bit/pixel.},

The corresponding renoising at the decoder is implemented using an efficient block-based approach suitable for use in consumer electronic devices. Preliminary results indicate that the approach can give significant bitrate savings (up to 50\%) on sequences with heavy film grain.},

The MFIA uses shift-adds instead of multipliers and common subexpression sharing to reduce the hardware costs, to increase the throughput, and to reduce the power dissipation. Two different versions of MC interpolators using MFIA are also presented in this brief. The MFIA and the two versions of MC interpolators were synthesized for 40-nm TSMC standard-cells. The results showed that the MC interpolators are able to process up to 4320 p videos at 30 frames/s, with a maximum power dissipation of 81.31 mW. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work presenting a hardware design for the MC of AV1.},

Recently, the development of two contenders for the next generation of standardized video codecs began: ISO/IEC and ITU-T advance the development of the Joint Exploration Model (JEM), a possible successor of HEVC, while the Alliance for Open Media pushes forward the video codec AV1. It is asserted by both groups that their codecs achieve superior coding efficiency over the state-of-the-art. In this paper, we discuss the distinguishing features of JEM and AV1 and evaluate their coding efficiency and computational complexity under well-defined and balanced test conditions. Our main findings are that JEM considerably outperforms HM and AV1 in terms of coding efficiency while AV1 cannot transform increased complexity into competitiveness in terms of coding efficiency with neither of the competitors except for the all-intra configuration.},

Alliance for Open Media (AOM), a joint development foundation, is targeting AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) as a royalty-free video coding format that is likely to be finalized before the end of 2017. Built on top of Google's VP9 codec, AV1 has brought in new coding tools from other open source royalty-free codecs. Multiple new royalty-free coding tools have been contributed by the members of AOM. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the coding gains offered by the default and experimental tools in AV1 and the corresponding decoding complexity increase for the over-the-top adaptive bit-rate streaming delivery use-cases. Also, the coding gains are compared against the compression performance of \$\textbackslash{}times\$ 264, \$\textbackslash{}times\$ 265, and libVP9 open-source codecs to highlight the potential bit savings possible with AV1 using multiple video quality metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio, structure similarity, and Netflix's Video Multi-Assessment Fusion metric. These results indicate that AV1 offers competitive compression performance over H.265 without significantly increasing the decoding complexity.},

  abstract = {This paper presents and discusses an objective performance evaluation of two lines of development for the next generation of video coding schemes: AV1 of the Alliance for Open Media (AOM) and JEM of the Joint Video Exploration Team (JVET). Their already established predecessors, as given by VP9 for AV1 and High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) for JEM, serve as references for this evaluation process. A large testset of 28 video sequences with different content, various resolution, and different frame rate has been used as the common data basis. For each sequence and each test candidate, four different rate points associated with varying qualities of reconstruction have been generated. When evaluated in this way relative to their corresponding predecessors, AV1 and JEM show a quite significant coding-efficiency improvement in terms of averaged Bj{\o}ntegaard-Delta (BD) bit rate of about 23\% and about 32\%, respectively. Moreover, this performance study also reveals that there exist different trade-offs between compression efficiency and computational complexity in terms of encoder run time. While the JEM encoder requires a factor of about 8.5 in run time relative to HM, the corresponding run time factor for the AV1 encoder is about 55.8 relative to VP9. When comparing the next-generation coding schemes among each other, this study reveals that AV1 requires an average BD bit-rate overhead of about 49\% at the same objective quality while consuming 2.47 times the run time of the JEM encoder.},

  abstract = {Videos can portray our thinking in a better way than anything can. As a result, online as well as offline videos in entertainment, health, storytelling, education and in surveillance are increasing day by day which further initiates video coding research to decrease the size while keeping satisfactory quality. Due to the ubiquitous necessity of video encoding, a fully functional, high performance and with easy licensing codec have been sought from industry and academia for a long time. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the software encoders of H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, VP9 and the new royalty free encoder AV1 from AOMedia for relatively small video files. To ensure fair analysis, we performed extensive experiments by varying different parameters. With default parameters, for the same video bitrates, AV1 obtains better quality as compared to other encodings. However, when we use the slowest time preset `placebo' for H.264 and H.265, AV1 goes slightly behind H.265. Among the other two, VP9 always outperforms H.264. For all schemes, as quality increases, the encoding time also increase.},

  abstract = {This work presents a performance evaluation of the current status of two distinct lines of development in future video coding technology: the so-called AV1 video codec of the industry-driven Alliance for Open Media (AOM) and the Joint Exploration Test Model (JEM), as developed and studied by the Joint Video Exploration Team (JVET) on Future Video Coding of ITU-T VCEG and ISO/IEC MPEG. As a reference, this study also includes reference encoders of the respective starting points of development, as given by the first encoder release of AV1/VP9 for the AOM-driven technology, and the HM reference encoder of the HEVC standard for the JVET activities. For a large variety of video sources ranging from UHD over HD to 360\textdegree{} content, the compression capability of the different video coding technology has been evaluated by using a Random Access setting along with the JVET common test conditions. As an outcome of this study, it was observed that the latest AV1 release achieved average bit-rate savings of \textasciitilde{}17\% relative to VP9 at the expense of a factor of \textasciitilde{}117 in encoder run time. On the other hand, the latest JEM release provides an average bit-rate saving of \textasciitilde{}30\% relative to HM with a factor of \textasciitilde{}10.5 in encoder run time. When directly comparing AV1 and JEM both for static quantization parameter settings, AV1 produces an average bit-rate overhead of more than 100\% relative to JEM at the same objective reconstruction quality and, in addition, with a factor of \textasciitilde{}2.7 in encoder run time. Even when operated in a two-pass ratecontrol mode, AV1 lags behind both the JEM and HM reference encoder with average bit-rate overheads of \textasciitilde{}55\% and \textasciitilde{}9.5\%, respectively, although the latter being configured along one-pass static quantization parameter settings.},

  abstract = {Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is the most widely used technique for image/video compression standards. In this paper, an FPGA based 8\texttimes{}8 forward Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) architectures are implemented for H.264 encoder and decoder respectively. It has been implemented using the pipelined structure for computing the Integer DCT and IDCT. The design is implemented without using any multiplication operation to reduce the complexity. H.264 is one of the recent video compression standards of the ITU-T Moving Picture Experts Group and Video Coding Experts Group. A pipelined architecture is used in this design to increase the speed of operation. The proposed resource effective architectures have been implemented and synthesized on xc2vp30 device that belongs to Vertex-2 Pro family. For Integer DCT architecture implementation, the resource utilization is 14\% slices, 1\% flip-flops, 11\% LUTs, 51\% 10Bs of xc2vp30 device and reaches an operating frequency of 520.996 MHz. For Integer IDCT architecture implementation, the resource utilization is 28\% slices, 2\% flip-flops, 24\% LUTs, 37\% 10Bs of xc2vp30 device and reaches an operating frequency of 525.22 MHz. In these designs, it takes only 49 clock cycles to generate the transformed outputs thus increasing the speed of operation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present area- and power-efficient architectures for the implementation of integer discrete cosine transform (DCT) of different lengths to be used in High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). We show that an efficient constant matrix-multiplication scheme can be used to derive parallel architectures for 1-D integer DCT of different lengths. We also show that the proposed structure could be reusable for DCT of lengths 4, 8, 16, and 32 with a throughput of 32 DCT coefficients per cycle irrespective of the transform size. Moreover, the proposed architecture could be pruned to reduce the complexity of implementation substantially with only a marginal affect on the coding performance. We propose power-efficient structures for folded and full-parallel implementations of 2-D DCT. From the synthesis result, it is found that the proposed architecture involves nearly 14\% less area-delay product (ADP) and 19\% less energy per sample (EPS) compared to the direct implementation of the reference algorithm, on average, for integer DCT of lengths 4, 8, 16, and 32. Also, an additional 19\% saving in ADP and 20\% saving in EPS can be achieved by the proposed pruning algorithm with nearly the same throughput rate. The proposed architecture is found to support ultrahigh definition 7680 \texttimes{} 4320 at 60 frames/s video, which is one of the applications of HEVC.},
